# Repository

[![Powered by Mason](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fmason-badge)](https://github.com/felangel/mason)

A new brick created with the Mason CLI.

With this brick, you would be able to add a new data repository to your app.
The repository criteria is the same used in the [Flutter Todos Example](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/tree/master/examples/flutter_todos/packages), ie. it will create three packages, the repository package, the API interface package and the API implementation package.

It will also run a pre_gen hook (mostly borrowed from [Luke Moody's](https://github.com/LukeMoody01) [model](https://github.com/LukeMoody01/mason_bricks/blob/master/bricks/model/hooks/pre_gen.dart) brick) to add methods to the API interface and will search for custom types and optionally create them running a bundled version of the [model](https://github.com/LukeMoody01/mason_bricks/tree/master/bricks/model) brick.
